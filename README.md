# SegNet and Bayesian SegNet Tutorial

This repository contains all files for running SegNet variants as described in my master's thesis. Forked from https://github.com/navganti/SegNet.

## caffe-segnet-cudnn5

SegNet requires a modified version of Caffe to run. Please see the [`caffe-segnet-cudnn5`](https://github.com/filipovyfusky/caffe-segnet-cudnn5) and follow the installation instructions.
